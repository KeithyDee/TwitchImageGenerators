# TwitchImageGenerators
Some scripts that will export images in the correct sizes for various Twitch images (emotes, badges, etc.)

## TwitchEmoteSaver

Saves the currently open image called `my_emote.psd` (for example) as three files in the same directory: `my_emote_112x112.png`, `my_emote_56x56.png`, and `my_emote_28x28.png`.
